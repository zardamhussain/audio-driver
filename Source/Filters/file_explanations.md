### Source/Utilities/kshelper.cpp
*   **What it does:** Implements Kernel Streaming (KS) helper functions and property handlers.
    *   `GetWaveFormatEx()`, `ValidatePropertyParams()`: Utilities.
    *   `PropertyHandler_BasicSupport*()`: Respond to `KSPROPERTY_TYPE_BASICSUPPORT` queries.
    *   `PropertyHandler_Volume()`, `PropertyHandler_Mute()`, `PropertyHandler_PeakMeter2()`: Actual GET/SET handlers, interacting with `PADAPTERCOMMON` to read/write to emulated hardware. Perform value normalization.
    *   `SimpleAudioSamplePropertyDispatch()`: Generic property dispatcher using `SIMPLEAUDIOSAMPLE_PROPERTY_ITEM`.
    *   `PropertyHandler_WaveFilter()`, `PropertyHandler_Topology()`, `PropertyHandler_GenericPin()`: Global "thunk" functions redirecting property requests to miniport objects.
*   **Why it was written this way:** Centralizes and abstracts KS property handling. `_BasicSupport` functions expose capabilities. Interaction with `PADAPTERCOMMON` links KS to HAL. `SimpleAudioSamplePropertyDispatch` improves modularity.
*   **Purpose in the driver stack:** Implements how the driver exposes and manages KS properties, translating KS requests into internal actions or HAL interactions.

### Source/Utilities/savedata.h
*   **What it does:** Declares the `CSaveData` class, a utility to save audio data to a file for debugging/logging.
    *   `class CSaveData`.
    *   Members: `m_hFile` (file handle), `m_bDataLogging` (enable/disable flag), `m_pWorkItems`, `m_pDeviceObject` (static for asynchronous writes).
    *   Methods: `CreateFile()`, `WriteData()` (asynchronous writes), `CloseFile()`, `SetDataLogging()`. Static `Init()`/`Deinit()`.
*   **Why it was written this way:** Saving data in kernel mode is complex. Asynchronous writes (via worker threads/DPCs) prevent blocking and maintain real-time audio.
*   **Purpose in the driver stack:** Debugging utility for inspecting raw audio data, verifying samples, and analyzing glitches without specialized hardware tools.

### Source/Utilities/savedata.cpp
*   **What it does:** Implements `CSaveData` for asynchronous file I/O.
    *   `SaveDataWorker()`: Worker thread function (runs at `PASSIVE_LEVEL`) that performs file I/O (`ZwCreateFile`, `ZwWriteFile`).
    *   `WriteData()`: Queues a work item (`PIO_WORKITEM`) to offload blocking file writes to a system worker thread.
*   **Why it was written this way:** Concrete implementation for safe asynchronous file I/O in kernel mode, crucial for maintaining real-time performance.
*   **Purpose in the driver stack:** Enables capturing/replaying audio streams from within the driver for debugging and testing without affecting real-time audio.

### Source/Utilities/ToneGenerator.h
*   **What it does:** Declares the `ToneGenerator` class, a utility for generating various audio tones. Used for testing capture paths.
    *   `class ToneGenerator`.
    *   Members: `m_Frequency`, `m_Amplitude`, `m_DCOffset`, `m_InitialPhase`, `m_BitsPerSample`, `m_SampleRate`, `m_uiWaveType` (sine, square, sawtooth).
    *   Methods: `Init()`, `GenerateSineWave16/32()`, `GenerateSquareWave16/32()`, `GenerateSawtoothWave16/32()`, `GenerateTone()`, `WriteTone()`.
*   **Why it was written this way:** Provides a controlled, predictable audio source for testing, especially for capture paths, by injecting synthetic tones. Supports different waveforms and bit depths for comprehensive testing.
*   **Purpose in the driver stack:** Diagnostic tool embedded in the driver for automated testing of capture pipelines and isolating audio data flow issues.

### Source/Utilities/ToneGenerator.cpp
*   **What it does:** Implements the `ToneGenerator` class, defining waveform generation algorithms.
    *   `Init()`: Initializes parameters for continuous tone generation.
    *   `GenerateSineWave*()`, `GenerateSquareWave*()`, `GenerateSawtoothWave*()`: Implement mathematical formulas for waveform generation.
    *   `WriteTone*()`: Writes generated tone data to a buffer, handling channel interleaving.
*   **Why it was written this way:** Provides concrete algorithms for audio synthesis. Handles different bit depths and buffer population.
*   **Purpose in the driver stack:** Self-contained audio source for internal driver testing, enabling reliable verification of audio data paths.
